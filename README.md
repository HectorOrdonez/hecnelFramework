Update 2023:

It's been 10 years! Wow, how time flies.

This was definitely a nice experiment I did back then and it taught me many things.
Kind of tempted to remove it from public domain, but I just don't have the heart :)

What started as merely following a tutorial about how to make your own framework turned into a multiple months project.

It was so much fun.

----------------------

This is a PHP Framework I've designed for learning purposes.

Started as a little project to learn about MVC design and how PHP Frameworks really work, it has been growing since then and now I am using it for my personal projects, making improvements in the way as I learn about what a Framework can have and how can make my developer life easier.

~~Still on development!~~
